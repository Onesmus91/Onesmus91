- 👋 Hi, I’m @Onesmus91
- 👀 I’m interested in website development with a zero background in computer science, but I feel this is my desire!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some basic coding languages c# to be specific.
- 💞️ I’m looking for someone, who can take me through this, from the very basic to be a pro. I know you are there and reading this.
- 📫 How to reach me via my email pesayupo2@gmail.com
